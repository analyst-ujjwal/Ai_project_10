# 🤖 Proactive-10 - AI Agent (Groq + LLaMA + Streamlit)

An intelligent multi-tool conversational agent built with **Streamlit**, powered by **Groq acceleration** and **LLaMA language models**.  
This project combines analytical reasoning, creativity, and automation — all inside a single interactive chat interface.

## 🚀 Overview

The **Proactive AI Agent** is designed to act as an autonomous assistant capable of:
- generating ideas,  
- analyzing data,  
- summarizing content,  
- performing sentiment analysis,  
- checking facts,  
- writing code explanations,  
- and much more.

The app is modular, with each “tool” acting as an independent capability (like a plugin).  
It’s a proof-of-concept for **agentic AI systems** that can proactively respond and assist based on user intent.
